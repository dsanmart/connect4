# A Knowledge-based Approach of Connect-Four

Note that current implementation is using only 4 fundamental rules out of the 9 defined in `rules.py`. This is still a WIP...

Since not all solutions are found by the algorithm with only 4 rules, a rudimentary approach is done by combining minimax and victor in `play.py`.

## Instructions to run the AI against the server:

### Run game.py
```python
python game.py
```

## Rules defined
- Claimeven
- Basinverse
- Vertical
- Afterven
- Lowinverse
- Highinverse
- Baseclaim
- Before
- SpecialBefore

## Rules implemented
- Claimeven
- Basinverse
- Vertical
- Before
